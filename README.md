Makerfarm-i3-6-inch-version
===========================

Makerfarm provided the source to their Makerfarm i3 printer
(a lasercut variant of the Prusa i3 printer) in a closed .pwj format. 
I have converted it to a more open format for those of us
that wish to view the file.  The source is provided in
svg, pdf, and dxf formats.

If others encounter a .pwj file, it can be opened with a program
called LaserGRAV:

LaserGRAV can then export the file in .plt format, which in turn
can be opened in Inkscape and converted to whatever format you require.
